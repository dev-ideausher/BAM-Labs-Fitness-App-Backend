        Create a personalized workout plan for the user based on the following exercises:

        Instructions:
        - Generate a workout plan for **all days** (no rest days).
        - Each day should have **4-5 exercises**. Choose the exercises that fit the user's goals and query.

        - Tailor exercise selection based on the user's goals, fitness level, and available equipment.
        - The workout duration should match the userâ€™s exercise session duration, **automatically determined by the AI**.
        - Ensure that the weight, sets, and reps are always included, even if their values are null.

        Provide the response in the following strict JSON format, grouped by days with exercises as values:
